# TIC TAC TOE
Introduction to Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet classic two-player game that is played on a 3×3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

Game Rules:
The game is played between two players, one using "X" and the other using "O."
Players take turns placing their marks on an empty square in the 3×3 grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.
